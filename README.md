# Spark Streaming Html Parser
Using Spark Streaming, visit multiple websites; for each site, extract text within one HTML tag based on ID.

For example, visit "http://www.amazon.com/LG-D820-Unlocked-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B017ROJ2NC", locate one HTML tag satisfying id equaling "priceblock_ourprice", then simply extract its text. Similarly, another link "http://www.zappos.com/josef-seibel-ruth-03", then id "priceSlot", get the text within.
